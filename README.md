# Community-Workshops
ECL course material for community workshops.

Data files in PARQUET format can be downloaded directly from the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page). If you have no easy way to convert these files to CSV, the two files that have been used in the workshop are available in this fork https://github.com/HWatanuki/Community-Workshops under the "Data" subfolder.
